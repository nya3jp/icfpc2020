# ICFPC 2020, Team Spacecat

## Summary

Spacecat is a team competed in [ICFP Programming Contest 2020],
consisting of 9 members: [@chiro], [@draftcode], [@gusmachine], [@kmyk],
[@nya3jp], [@ogiekako], [@phoenixstarhiro], [@shunsakuraba], and [@tanakh].

This repository contains all the code we wrote for the contest.

We used Rust and C++ to build [bots to play the space fighting game] for the
final round, TypeScript to build [a Galaxy Pad implementation],
Go, Python, Ruby, OCaml to build support infrastructure, utilities, and so on.

Note that we decided the team name after the lightning round. Until then our
team name on the system was `???` tentatively.
